## Backend Mid Developer Test

### Guidelines

Prerequisite:
- Docker

In this source code has refactored and written to adopt Clean Architecture with some modified code and directory styles.
Every file has separated to its functionality. And the flow of this API application started from Router -> Handler -> Service -> Repository (DB).


#### Installation & Running
1. Copy file `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` in the directory `/configs` (if not existed) for application variables

### API Documentation
There are file `./apispec.json` and `./docs.postman_collection.json` to look up the API docs

#### Testing Steps
- run `make generate-mocks` to mock all the necessary testing code
- run `make test-verbose` or `make test` for overall unit test running
- run `make coverage` or `make coverage-html` to know how many code coverage
